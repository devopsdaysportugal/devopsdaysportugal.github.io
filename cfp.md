The conference this year will focus on real world experience reports from diverse organizations in Portugal and abroad. Covered topics will include Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, and Sharing (CALMS), and others.

Each day will feature a combination of selected talks, ignite talks (5 minutes long), and open space (group discussions). The talks will be presented in a single track while the open space discussions will happen in parallel (according to the topics suggested by the audience).

The selected speakers will likely include local speakers as well as foreign speakers. The goal is to strengthen and promote the local community/reality and at the same time learn from international experiences. A special attention will be given to diversity and newcomers. We value new and diverse points of view.

## What we are looking for

Our interest this year is for talks focused on real world experience reports from diverse organizations in Portugal and abroad. We want to explore the “why?” and the “how?” of organizational transformations and the techniques employed to the changes in organizations, both large and small. Failure reports are also welcome, since there is so much to learn from that.

Covered topics will include Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, and Sharing (CALMS), and others.

Here are some ideas that could fit into that perspective:

* How DevOps culture and practices helped organization A reach a growth milestone or revamp * a dying business…
* How org X has designed learning experiences to enable high performance within the * organization…
* How a focus on diversity and inclusion at company X has benefited the company and it’s * results …
* How Devops culture and practices has helped Org B make Event X a major success…
* How org C modified its organization and communication paths and practices to enable high performance…
For talks, these should be deliverable in 30 minutes; for Ignites, they should be focused as described on the Ignites format page and limited to 5 minutes.

Submission and analysis is anonymous, so that we can remove as much bias as possible from the analysis process.

For this event, we are considering all talks and ignites to be in english.
